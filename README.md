  A *Terminal User Interface* **Quiz Game Engine** written entirely in C++.

  Made with love by [trintlermint](#credits).

  Read *[my blog](https://blog.trintler.me/2026/03/28/Certamen-the-TUI-Quizzing-App/)* documenting the development process for this project.
  ## Author *Quizzes* and seamlessly "test" yourself in a full-screen TUI; host the game over SSH for you and your friends to play!
  > This way, you get to make fun of their... incredibly (lacking) *haskell* knowledge for example!

## Building

### Releases
I have now setup Github Releases through Actions, if you want to skip the headache of building the program, feel free to head over to [**releases**](https://github.com/trintlermint/certamen/releases/latest).

> [!WARNING]
> This repository has just been moved from Github to Codeberg due to concerns regarding licensing, ownership of code, and ethics. Please wait for me to fix the current CI/CD, packages, etc to be written for codeberg. Thank you!

#### AUR
To download **Certamen** from the ArchLinux User Repository, do the following:

```bash
sudo pacman -S certamen
```
> Or any equivalent command using your AUR package helper.

#### Nix (CLI)
To download **Certamen** as a Nix package, do the following:

```bash
... to come by @valyntyler.
```

> [!WARNING]
> To be clear, the Nix package supports the earlier CLI version named `quizzer`, if you want to get the updated TUI, please compile from source, OR help contribute! See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Dependencies

Certamen uses these predominant three libraries:

| Library | Version | Install |
|---------|---------|---------|
| [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI) | v6.1.9 | Fetched automatically by CMake via `FetchContent` |
| [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) | >= 0.7 | System package required |
| [libssh](https://www.libssh.org/) | >= 0.9 | System package required |

You also need a **C++17 compiler (GCC >= 8 or Clang >= 7)** and **CMake >= 3.14**.

### CMake

**Ubuntu / Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libyaml-cpp-dev libssh-dev
```

**Fedora / RHEL:**

```bash
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake yaml-cpp-devel libssh-devel
```

**Arch Linux (AUR):**

```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake yaml-cpp libssh
```

> Or any other equivalent function to install these packages on your UNIX machine.

Next, clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trintlermint/certamen.git
cd certamen
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

The binary compiles into an executable, stored at `build/bin/certamen`. Run:

```bash
./build/bin/certamen ./example_quiz.yaml
```

Without arguments it looks for `./quiz.yaml` in the current working directory being run from.

### macOS and Windows

**Homebrew**:

```bash
brew install cmake yaml-cpp libssh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

**Windows** (using vcpkg + MSVC):

```bash
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> I am NOT a macOS OR Windows user; Manuals told me this should work, if it does or doesn't please inform me on Github Issues! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Manual compilation (CLI)

If yaml-cpp are installed system-wide and you want to skip CMake entirely, you can compile the CLI, the CLI is the previously, originally known "quizzer" app; faithfully renamed.

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -O2 main.cpp -lyaml-cpp -o certamen
```
> [!NOTE]
> This builds a local-only binary without the TUI or SSH server. Use the CMake build for the included features.

---

## Usage

### Offline User Mode

```bash
certamen quiz.yaml
```


The TUI (when opened using `certamen`) presents a menu with keyboard (j/k), (up/down/left/right) and number-key navigation:

1. *Take Quiz*; answer questions (`bool: randomiser`), get scored at the end
2. *Add Question*; compose a question with choices, optional code snippet, and explanation
3. *Remove Question*; delete a question
4. *Change Answer*; update the correct answer for an existing question
5. *Edit Choice*; update the text contents of a selected question's choice.
6. *List Questions*; browse all questions with toggleable answers, code, and explanations
7. *Set Author and Name*; set metadata describing the author/name.
8. *Save*; Save all changes and view diffs.
9. *Load Quiz File*; (Un)load quiz .yaml files into the current session.

There are a few more functionalities:
- Press `r` on the main menu to toggle randomized question *and* answer order.
- Press `q` anywhere to QUIT the program.

Furthermore, if you wish, you can import more than one .yaml file, you do this by executing:
`certamen 1.yaml 2.yaml ... n.yaml` for any `n` number of yaml files you desire.
This will then be loaded into the session, to manipulate them such as loading, unloading them, go to the "Load Quiz File" option.
Here, you can Load new files, or get rid of them in the current session.

> [!NOTE]
> The same applies to the Server hosting the SSH!

### SSH server mode

Host a quiz for others to connect to with any SSH client:

```bash
certamen serve quiz.yaml                                  # default
certamen serve --password mysecret --port 2222 quiz.yaml  # port and pass
certamen serve --port 3000 algebra.yaml history.yaml      # port, max client
```

Players connect with `ssh -p <port> <name>@<host>` and get the same TUI in an *isolated* "quiz" session. The server logs scores per player.

| Flag | Default | Desc |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--port <N>` | 2222 | TCP listen port |
| `--password <pw>` | *(open)* | Require password authentication |
| `--key <path>` | `certamen_host_rsa` | RSA host key (auto gen on first run) |
| `--max-clients <N>` | 8 | Concurrent connection limit |

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Full server shell documentation: **[SERVING.md](SERVING.md)**. Also, password is currently having issues currently.

## Quiz format

Quizzes are YAML files. Each question is a map in a top-to-down sequence which is nested inside `questions`:

```yaml
name: Certamen DEMO
author: trintlermint
questions:
  - question: Which of the Haskell functions below can calculate the Euclidean norm sqrt(a^2 + b^2)?
    code: |
      nrm1 :: Double -> Double -> Double
      nrm1 a b = sqrt (a^2 + b^2)

      nrm2 :: (Double, Double) -> Double
      nrm2 (a, b) = sqrt (a^2 + b^2)

    explain: |
      Both definitions compute sqrt (a^2 + b^2), one by separate arguments and one by a tuple, using only sqrt and (^).

    choices:
      - Only nrm1 is a correct implementation.
      - Only nrm2 is a correct implementation.
      - nrm1 and nrm2 are both correct implementations.
      - nrm1 and nrm2 are both incorrect implementations.
    answer: 2
  - question: Is the else part in a Haskell if expression mandatory?
    explain: |
      Haskell's if is an expression and requires both then and else branches.
    ...

```

- `question`, `choices` >= 2, and `answer` are required. `code` and `explain` are optional.
- `answer` is a *0-based* index into `choices`. The TUI displays 1-based numbering to the player.
- `name`, `author` are optional and are metadata only at the start of the file
- `language` is an optional field for syntax highlight hinting (e.g. `language: haskell`) (see `syntax.cpp` for what has been implemented thus far).

> See [`example_quiz.yaml`](example_quiz.yaml) for a working template and helping me stop writing stuff.

## Troubleshooting

**This project was made rather fast by my standards due to this thing called "Computer Addiction and writing in Helix." Due to these factors, the code is bound to break. I would lovingly accept any Contributions, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), or even a trivial github issue.**

*Anyway*,

<details>
<summary><b>Missing yaml-cpp headers</b></summary>
<br/>
Install the development package for your distribution:
<ul>
  <li><b>Debian/Ubuntu:</b> <code>sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev</code></li>
  <li><b>Fedora/RHEL:</b> <code>sudo dnf install yaml-cpp-devel</code></li>
  <li><b>Arch:</b> <code>sudo pacman -S yaml-cpp</code></li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Missing libssh headers</b></summary>
<br/>
<ul>
  <li><b>Debian/Ubuntu:</b> <code>sudo apt-get install libssh-dev</code></li>
  <li><b>Fedora/RHEL:</b> <code>sudo dnf install libssh-devel</code></li>
  <li><b>Arch:</b> <code>sudo pacman -S libssh</code></li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Permission denied when saving</b></summary>
<br/>
Certamen needs write access to the YAML file and its parent directory. Check ownership and permissions (varies based on OS).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>YAML parse errors</b></summary>
<br/>
The file must be a YAML sequence of maps. Required keys per entry: <code>question</code>, <code>choices</code>, <code>answer</code>. Optional: <code>code</code>, <code>explain</code>, <code>language</code>. See `example_quiz.yaml` for more details.
</details>
